#### Java Trading Bot based on "Building Trading Bots Using Java" by Shekhar Varshney

This will be an ongoing project to learn more about creating bots and automated 
processes in Java and getting more familiar with Financial Service APIs 
(OANDA in this case).

I have a good understanding of financial markets, and a basic understanding of
FOREX markets. So I felt this would be a great project to explore on the side
with real world business use cases where I can apply personal experience.
