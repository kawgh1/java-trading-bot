#### Java Trading Bot based on the book "Building Trading Bots Using Java" by Shekhar Varshney

This will be an ongoing project to learn more about creating bots and automated 
processes in Java and getting more familiar with Financial Service APIs 
(OANDA in this case).

I have a good understanding of financial markets, and a basic understanding of
FOREX (world currency) markets. So I felt this would be a great project to explore on the side
with real world business use cases where I can apply personal experience.


#### Requirements
To build this bot I am going to use the following set of software and tools:

• Java SDK 1.7+

• Spring Framework 4.1 

• Spring Social 1.1 (dependency in the tradingbot-app project only)

• Guava 18.0

• HttpClient 4.3

• Maven 3.2.5

• IntelliJ IDE
